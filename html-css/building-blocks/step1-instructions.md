In PatternFly, components which cannot be broken down into smaller parts are known as the basic building blocks of user interfaces. Examples include the button, label and badge components.

This step will look at the button component.

## Task: Add a button component

1) <strong>Copy code into the index.html file.</strong>

Click the <strong>Copy to Editor</strong> button below to add html for a button component to the `index.html` file.

<pre class="file" data-filename="index.html" data-target="replace">
&lt;button class=&quot;pf-c-button pf-m-primary&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;
  Primary
&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>

2) <strong>Let's add one more button component.</strong>

Click the <strong>Copy to Editor</strong> button below to add html for two button components to the `index.html` file.

<pre class="file" data-filename="index.html" data-target="replace">
&lt;button class=&quot;pf-c-button pf-m-primary&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;
  Primary
&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class=&quot;pf-c-button pf-m-primary&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;
  Primary
&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>
