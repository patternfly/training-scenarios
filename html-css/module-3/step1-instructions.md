Components have multiple variations due in part to the use of modifier classes, which override or add new styling to the same component. Modifiers use the “pf-m-” prefix, followed by a suitable name for the modifier. Patternfly aims to use consistent names for modifiers across components, however the styles for each modifier are specific to that component element.

## Task: Modify modifier classes to the badge component
a. Let’s start <strong>modifying the modifier class</strong> for a simple component, the badge.
Note: the badge is a component that requires a modifier.

b. <strong>Copy code to the editor.</strong> 
Click the <strong>Copy to Editor</strong> button below to add html for a Badge to the index.html file.

<pre class="file" data-filename="index.html" data-target="replace">
&lt;!--Badge.html--&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pf-c-badge pf-m-unread&quot;&gt;
  200
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pf-c-badge pf-m-unread&quot;&gt;
  300
&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>

c. You should see <strong>two badges</strong> appear with the background-color of blue. The modifier class: `pf-m-unread` modifies its styles to be “unread”.

d. The badge also has a “read” state. <strong>Your task is to update the second badge so that it has the modifier for “read”.</strong> What did the background color change to?
