The Gallery Layout is designed so that all of its children are of uniform size, displayed horizontally and wrap responsively.

## Task: Layout cards in a gallery format using the gutter

a. Add `pf-l-gallery` to the parent `<div>` container. This will structure any children inside of the gallery into a grid layout, whereby the columns donâ€™t extend beyond 250px in width, and when this happens they add more columns and wrap.

b. Add `pf-m-gutter` to the `pf-l-gallery`. This will add vertical and horizontal spacing of 24px between the card elements.
