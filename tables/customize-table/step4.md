Without any customization, row <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys" target="_blank">keys</a> use the format `${idx}-row`. So, row 1 will have the key `0-row`, row 2 will have the key `1-row`, and so on. In this step, we'll learn how to customize the format used for your row keys.

## Task

1) Locate your rows definition `const defaultRows = [`

2) For each of the row objects, supply a property named `customStaticProperty` as a sibling to each `cells` property, and set their value to a string that corresponds to the row semantically. For example, `customStaticProperty: "myfirst"`. Your rows definition should generally look like the following;

<pre class="file">
  {
    customStaticProperty: "myfirst",
    cells: [...]
  },
  {
    customStaticProperty: "mysecond",
    cells: [...]
  },
  {
    customStaticProperty: "mythird",
    cells: [...]
  },
</pre>

<strong>Note: </strong> customStaticProperty is just a random property name for example sake. You can decorate your row definitions with your own custom properties as necessary to your needs.

3) Locate your `<TableBody />` component

4) Set the `rowKey` prop for the TableBody component to a string value that is the name of the custom property you just attached to each of your row definitions.

<pre class="file">
rowKey="customStaticProperty"
</pre>

By doing this, your row keys will now take the form of `${rowKey}-row`, so in our case we'd have row keys that look like;

<!-- TODO: insert validation for this step here -->

<ul>
  <li>myfirst-row</li>
  <li>mysecond-row</li>
  <li>mythird-row</li>
</ul>

Setting `rowKey` to a static string value is a convenient way to customize the row keys for your table. You can also customize individual row cell keys.

3) Locate the code that defines the first column of the first row `{ title: "Row 1 column 1" }`

4) Specify a custom key by adding a props object as you've done previously, and explicitly set the `key` property to a custom string value "row-one-column-one-key".

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
{ title: "Row 1 column 1", props: { key: 'row-one-column-one-key' } },
</pre>

Only the single cell you've set the custom `key` property for will reflect the change, all the other keys will be autogenerated just as they were previously.

At this point, your table should still look exactly the same as it did at the end of step 2.
