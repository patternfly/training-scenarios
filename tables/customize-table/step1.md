The PatternFly React Table package provides a collection of React components and generic functions you can use to build tables with dynamic markup, styling, and behavior.

In this course, we're going to build another PatternFly Table together - we'll start with a basic table implementation similar to where we left off in the <a href="https://katacoda.com/seanforyou23/courses/tables/intro-table" target="_blank">intro table course</a>.

First, we'll look at what it takes to add a variety of custom styles and attributes to further customize the table.

Next we will look at how we can customize `key` properties which help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

Finally we'll look at how some of the built in transforms work.
