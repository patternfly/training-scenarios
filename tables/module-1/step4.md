Even basic tables need to be able to account for the case of large dataset. In this step, we'll look at how we can address this from a styling perspective.

## Task

1) Locate the Table component (`<Table ...>`)

2) Add a `variant` prop to the Table component, and set its value to `"compact"`

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
variant="compact"
</pre>

Notice the table head, rows, and cells become compressed and take up less vertical space so you can fit more data on the screen at one time.

<img src="module-1/assets/step-4-complete.png" alt="Image of what table looks like at the end of step 4." style="box-shadow: rgba(3, 3, 3, 0.2) 0px 1.25px 2.5px 0px;" />
