A PatternFly React form is a group of elements used to collect information from a user. Forms can be presented to the user in a variety of contexts depending on the use case and scenario.

The PatternFly React library provides a collection of React form demos you can use to build more complex interfaces with consistent markup, styling, and behavior. In this course, we're going to build a PatternFly form together - starting with a demo, adding content, and concluding with modifying the form.
