Now we'll add content to the `CardBody` of our card..

## Task

1) Make sure the app.js file is still open

2) Locate the code that looks like the following:

<pre class="file">
&lt;CardBody&gt;
&lt;/CardBody&gt;
</pre>

3) Replace that section with the following code:

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
&lt;CardBody&gt;

&lt;/CardBody&gt;
</pre>

Once the preview reloads - it should look like this:

CardBody is the React component used to place content into the body of the Card.  We'll continue to add more details to the card header in the next step.
