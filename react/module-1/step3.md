Now we'll add content to the `CardBody` of our card..

## Task

1) Make sure the App.js file is still open

2) Locate the code that looks like the following:

<pre class="file">
&lt;CardBody&gt;
&lt;/CardBody&gt;
</pre>

3) Replace that section with the following code:

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
&lt;CardBody&gt;

&lt;/CardBody&gt;
</pre>

Once the preview reloads - it should look like this:
<img src="module-1/assets/card-with-body.png" alt="Card with body content" style="box-shadow: rgba(3, 3, 3, 0.2) 0px 1.25px 2.5px 0px;" />

CardBody is the React component used to place content into the body of the Card.  We'll continue to add more details to the card header in the next step.
