Now we'll modify our cards.

## Task

1) Add a cool hover effect to the `Card` component

PatternFly components, including card, can be customized with props. You can add a hover effect to your cards with the `isHoverable` prop.

Add the following code to the `Card` component:

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
&lt;Card isHoverable&gt;
</pre>


2) Change the button in the `CardFooter` component into a blue action button

You can change the variant to get different kinds of buttons.

Replace the `CardFooter` component with the following code:

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
&lt;CardFooter&gt;
  &lt;Button variant="primary"&gt;Link to PatternFly&lt;/Button&gt;
&lt;/CardFooter&gt;
</pre>

When these steps are complete, your page should look like this when you hover over a card:

<img src="module-2/assets/step3.png" alt="Page demo with cards and hover effect" style="box-shadow: rgba(3, 3, 3, 0.2) 0px 1.25px 2.5px 0px;" />
