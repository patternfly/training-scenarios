Toolbars can be included to allow a user to manage and manipulate a data set. Data can be presented in any valid presentation, a table, a list, or a data visualization (chart), for example. The PatternFly Toolbar component is a flexible layout system that accommodates a variety of configurations that can be adapted to your specific needs.

In this tutorial, you will build a toolbar filter and attach it to a table. The image below is what we'll end up with when we are done.
<img src="filter-toolbar/assets/final.png" alt="Completed toolbar filter with table" style="box-shadow: rgba(3, 3, 3, 0.2) 0px 1.25px 2.5px 0px;" />
