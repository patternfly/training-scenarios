PatternFly React is made up of components, layouts and demos.

The PatternFly React library provides a collection of React components you can use to build interfaces with consistent markup, styling, and behavior.  In this course, we're going to build a PatternFly card together - starting with content, adding a header and some actions, and concluding with a card footer. You'll learn a little bit about React and how to use PatternFly components together to build a consistent experience. We'll also show how to use PatternFly layouts to put the components together.
