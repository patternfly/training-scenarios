Module 4: Using Patternfly Layouts


In Patternfly, layouts are the containers that allow for organizing and grouping elements.

You should use layouts over writing custom CSS, as layouts allow components to remain modular, as the layouts handle the styles necessary to position components in different contexts. Layout styles should never be part of a component.

We will go over our 7 different layouts: bullseye, flex, gallery, grid, level, split and stack.
