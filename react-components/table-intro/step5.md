Table components are commonly used to handle large datasets. Specialized visual treatment is available for such cases.

1) <strong>Set the table to compact mode</strong>

Locate the `<Table />` component and add a `variant` <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html" target="_blank">property</a>, setting its value to `compact`.

<pre class="file">
variant="compact"
</pre>

<strong>Note: </strong> Notice the table head, rows, and cells become compressed and take up less vertical space in order to fit more data on the screen at one time.
